# startCodeForTesting1
This project contains start code for an exercise given at cphbusiness.dk for the educations:
* AP degree in Computer Science
* Top-up Bachelor's degree in Software Developement

● Explain the necessary steps you did to make the code testable, and some of the patterns involved in this step <br>
> _By following the guided tutorial, the code has been refactored from a) the `DateFormatter` which is now using an interface `IDateFormatter` to change the static method `getFormattedDate()` that injects the Date instance as an argument, that solves the dependency problem; b) to `JokeFetcher` which is now using polymorphism wherein each joke has its own class that implements an interface `IJokeFetcher` since we know that this project is fetching jokes from various open REST APIs and it might differ in response value, so each joke has its own implementation of the method `getJoke()`. In addition, it uses a `FetcherFactory` implementing `IFetcherFactory` which is basically using a Factory Method Pattern, it makes sure that it returns the right types after implementing the logic required in instantiating JokeFetcher types._<br>

● Execute your test cases <br>
> _JokerTestSuite Result(consists of DateFormatterTest, JokeFetcherTest and FetcherFactoryTest):_<br>

● Explain basically about JUnit, Hamcrest, Mockito and Jacoco, and what problems they solve for testers <br>
> _A. JUNIT - a framework for unit testing in Java. It is very useful in testing small parts of the program automatically. It makes it easier to identify and fix the problem._<br>
_B. HAMCREST - together with the JUnit, hamcrest helps to easily understand/read a test code. It has matcher objects which is often used in automated testing._<br>
_C. MOCKITO - a mocking framework for Java that allows the creation of test double objects/mock objects in automated unit tests. It uses Java Reflection in order to create mock objects for a given interface._<br>
_D. JACOCO - a code coverage library for Java. It is useful in meaasuring the test coverage described to which the source code of the program is executed when a partiicular test suite runs._<br>

● Demonstrate how you used Mockito to mock away external Dependencies <br>
> _Add dependency in the pom.xml:_<br>

```
<dependency> 
  <groupId>org.mockito</groupId> 
  <artifactId>mockito-all</artifactId> 
  <version>1.9.5</version> 
  <scope>test</scope> 
</dependency> 
 ```

● Demonstrate how/where you did state-based testing and how/where you did behaviour based testing <br>
> _This test did state based testing wherein it asserts the expeted state of the object. On the other hand, it also did behavior based testing as it verifies that it behaves as we expect, it only calls the `getFormattedDate()` exactly one time._<br>

● Explain about Coverage Criterias, using the results presented by running Jacoco (or a similar tool) against you final test code. <br>
> _This results shows the instructions(information about the amount of code that has been executed), branches(calculates all if and switch statements), cyclomatic complexity(summarizes the complexity of classes), lines, methods, and classes._<br>

_This is the result generated by running Jacoco at target/site/jacoco/index.html:_<br>

_By package:_<br>

_And if we go deeper to see detailed coverage of a class(JokeFetcher)_<br>

● Explain/demonstrate what was required to make this project use, JUnit (Hamcrest), Mockito and Jacoco <br>
> _Most likely, it was mentioned from previous bullets. First thing, adding the corresponding dependencies and the knowledge on how to use it - thanks for the guided steps, helped a lot ;-)_
