# B. Parwise testing
_2. Use pairwise testing technique to create a reduced number of
test cases based on a combination of criteria for project above<br>
a) You might want to use tool to generate pairwise or threewise combinations_<br>

Pairwise testing can be thorough kind of testing. It is not fully automatic since it still requires manual work of defining what to be tested, then takes that description and generates the  pairwise tests automatically.

_HOW WE CAN USE PAIRWISE TESTING FOR THE GUTENBERG PROJECT_

If the Stakeholder has the requirement for the program to work on a number of specific browsers, different resolutions and internet connections we could test for 
each feature with all those combined parameters.

All feature generate success, not found or invalid input page depending on input. The Pair tool with the input parameters can be run from this [page](https://pairwise.teremokgames.com/1k68/).

All possible combination is 82. Results for pairwise is only 9 the CSV file can be found [here](https://github.com/Ansty93/Soft_test_cucumber/blob/master/pairwise_results/Pairwise_Gutenberg.xlsx%20-%20Pairwise.csv)
